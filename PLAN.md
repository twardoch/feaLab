# feaLab Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

feaLab is a Python library providing tools for working with OpenType Layout features and the AFDKO FEA language. The codebase shows promise but needs modernization, better documentation, comprehensive testing, and improved deployment/installation procedures. This plan outlines a systematic approach to transform feaLab into a robust, maintainable, and user-friendly library.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Clear Purpose**: Well-defined scope for OpenType feature handling
2. **HarfBuzz Integration**: Leverages powerful text shaping capabilities
3. **Modular Design**: Separate modules for different functionalities
4. **Apache License**: Open source friendly licensing

### Weaknesses
1. **Python 2.7 Target**: Outdated Python version (EOL since 2020)
2. **Minimal Documentation**: Only a one-line README
3. **No Test Suite**: No visible unit tests or integration tests
4. **Limited Error Handling**: Basic error handling in code
5. **Incomplete Features**: Placeholder writers that don't generate actual features
6. **Platform Limitations**: macOS-focused installation script
7. **Dependency Management**: Relies on system-level HarfBuzz installation
8. **No CI/CD**: No automated testing or deployment pipeline
9. **Mixed Code Quality**: Inconsistent coding standards across modules

## Improvement Strategy

### Phase 1: Modernization and Stabilization (Priority: Critical)

#### 1.1 Python 3 Migration
- **Objective**: Migrate entire codebase to Python 3.8+
- **Rationale**: Python 2.7 is EOL; modern Python offers better features and performance
- **Steps**:
  1. Update `fontTools.misc.py23` imports to direct Python 3 equivalents
  2. Convert string handling to proper Unicode/bytes distinction
  3. Update `setup.py` to target Python 3.8+
  4. Use `2to3` tool for initial conversion, then manual refinement
  5. Replace `sh` module with `subprocess` for better control and error handling
  6. Update type hints throughout the codebase

#### 1.2 Dependency Modernization
- **Objective**: Improve dependency management and reduce external dependencies
- **Steps**:
  1. Replace `sh` module with native `subprocess` calls
  2. Consider using `uharfbuzz` Python bindings instead of command-line tools
  3. Update `harfpy` dependency or migrate to maintained alternatives
  4. Create proper `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`
  5. Add `pyproject.toml` for modern Python packaging

#### 1.3 Error Handling and Logging
- **Objective**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Steps**:
  1. Add Python `logging` module throughout
  2. Create custom exception classes for different error types
  3. Implement proper validation for inputs
  4. Add graceful fallbacks for missing dependencies

### Phase 2: Testing and Quality Assurance (Priority: High)

  5. Configure `isort` for import sorting

#### 2.3 Continuous Integration
- **Objective**: Automate testing and quality checks
- **Steps**:
  1. Set up GitHub Actions workflows
  2. Test on multiple Python versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
  3. Test on multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
  4. Add coverage reporting with Codecov
  5. Automate dependency updates with Dependabot

### Phase 3: Feature Completion (Priority: High)

#### 3.1 Implement Actual Feature Writers
- **Objective**: Replace placeholder writers with functional implementations
- **Steps**:
  1. Implement real `KernFeatureWriter` that generates kern features
  2. Implement real `MarkFeatureWriter` for mark/mkmk features
  3. Add configurable options for feature generation
  4. Support different feature formats and variations

#### 3.2 Enhanced Script Support
- **Objective**: Improve Unicode and OpenType script handling
- **Steps**:
  1. Complete implementation of script conversion functions
  2. Add comprehensive script and language mappings
  3. Support for complex scripts and edge cases
  4. Validate against Unicode standards

#### 3.3 API Enhancement
- **Objective**: Create more intuitive and powerful APIs
- **Steps**:
  1. Design consistent API across all modules
